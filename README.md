Source Files to help decompile the file formats found in Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic

These files have been written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio 2015. They are a work in progress and are by no means in a final state. They currently do work one the files I have tested.

The files have been pulled from a larger project I am working on so you will have to do some reworking for your use case.
